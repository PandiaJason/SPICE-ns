# Visualizing Planets Mobility with SPICE-ns under ns-3 Traces

![SPICE-ns-output](https://github.com/PandiaJason/SPICE-ns-Project/assets/100123063/a1106f63-51bf-44d0-9e3d-c6fda12e6c5d)

This Python script is designed to visualize the mobility traces of celestial bodies within the solar system using SPICE-ns integrated with ns-3. It reads mobility trace data from a file generated by ns-3, extracts the XYZ coordinates of specified celestial bodies, and plots their trajectories in a 3D space.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Usage
1. Ensure that you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
2. Install the required dependencies using pip:
    ```
    pip install numpy matplotlib
    ```
3. Modify the `spDict` dictionary in the script to specify the celestial bodies you want to visualize along with their corresponding colors.
4. Run the script using the following command:
    ```
    python SPICE-ns-Vis.py
    ```

## Description
- The script reads mobility trace data from the "SPICE-ns-3-Mobility-Trace.mob" file.
- It then extracts XYZ coordinates for the specified celestial bodies from the data.
- The extracted coordinates are plotted in a 3D space, with each celestial body represented by a different color.
- The plot includes a legend indicating the names of the celestial bodies.
- The title and supertitle provide additional information about the reference frame and duration of the data.

## Sample Output
The script generates a 3D plot showing the trajectories of the specified celestial bodies within the solar system.
