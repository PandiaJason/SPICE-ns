# 📡 SPICE-ns - An Extension for ns-3 to Simulate DSN and DTN


- 🌐 Idealized the Proof of Concept for integrating CSPICE with ns3.
- 🚧 SPICE-ns is under development, an extension for ns3 that supports various aspects of deep space network simulations.
- ✅ Successfully Integrated CSPICE under ns3.
- ✅ Developed an Accurate Deep Space Mobility Model under ns3 with SPICE-ns.
- 🚀 As a first step, we have successfully implemented a mobility model for SPICE-ns and a paper is proposed to be presented at WNS3, Spain 2024.

### 🚧 Note 
The code and information presented in this document are currently under development and are not ready for public distribution. This is a work in progress, and certain features may not be fully implemented or tested. Any use or distribution of the code is discouraged until an official release is made.

📊 Meantime, one can check some of the preliminary results in "Outputs" Folder.

### 📜 Declaration
We are actively processing an application for getting grant to support the future development of SPICE-ns. Consequently, the source code for SPICE-ns, inclusive of the grantor's affiliation, will soon be made accessible on this page.

### 🎯 Long-term Goal

The long-term goal of this project is to develop a complete extension called 'SPICE-ns' for ns-3 to perform DSN/DTN simulations.

In the future, we plan to incrementally implement other aspects necessary to simulate a complete DSN/DTN.
