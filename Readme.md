# 📡 SPICE-ns - An Extension for ns-3 to Simulate DSN and DTN

**🚧 Note** The code and information presented in this document are currently under development and are not ready for public distribution. This is a work in progress, and certain features may not be fully implemented or tested. Any use or distribution of the code is discouraged until an official release is made.

📊 Meantime, one can check some of the preliminary results in "Outputs" Folder.

## 📜 Declaration
We are actively processing an application for getting grant to support the future development of SPICE-ns. Consequently, the source code for SPICE-ns, inclusive of the grantor's affiliation, will soon be made accessible on this page.

# 🎯 Long-term Goal

The long-term goal of this project is to develop a complete extension called 'SPICE-ns' for ns-3 to perform DSN/DTN simulations.

In the future, we plan to incrementally implement other aspects necessary to simulate a complete DSN/DTN.

## 🧩 SPICE-ns Modules 

- SPICE-antenna
- SPICE-applications
- SPICE-energy
- SPICE-mac
- SPICE-network
- SPICE-obstacle-model
- SPICE-phy
- SPICE-propagation
- SPICE-spectrum
- SPICE-visualization

## 🚀 Project Status 

As a first step, we have successfully implemented a mobility model for SPICE-ns.
