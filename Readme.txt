# SPICE-ns - An Extension for ns-3 to Simulate DSN and DTN 

**Note:** The code and information presented in this document are currently under development and are not ready for public distribution. This is a work in progress, and certain features may not be fully implemented or tested. Any use or distribution of the code is discouraged until an official release is made.

## Declaration
Generative AI has been used to get information about the SPICE toolkit API functions and Kernels, particularly the binary kernels.
Concurrently, we are actively processing an application for getting grant to support the future development of SPICE-ns. Consequently, the source code for SPICE-ns, inclusive of the grantor's affiliation, will soon be made accessible on GitHub

# Long-term Goal

The long-term goal of this project is to develop a complete extension called 'SPICE-ns' for ns-3 to perform DSN/DTN simulations.

In the future, we plan to incrementally implement other aspects necessary to simulate a complete DSN/DTN.

## SPICE-ns Modules

- antenna
- applications
- energy
- mac
- network
- obstacle-model
- phy
- propagation
- spectrum
- visualization

## Project Status

As a first step, we have successfully implemented a mobility model for SPICE-ns.
